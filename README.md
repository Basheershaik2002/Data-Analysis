# Image Processing with NumPy, Matplotlib, and PIL

Overview

This project explores fundamental image processing techniques using Pythonâ€™s powerful libraries: NumPy, Matplotlib, and PIL (Pillow). The goal is to understand how digital images can be manipulated at the pixel level and visualized using different transformations.

Features

Image Loading & Display: Use PIL to open images and Matplotlib to visualize them.

Image Conversion to NumPy Arrays: Transform images into numerical arrays for easy processing.

Color Channel Manipulation: Extract and modify individual Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) channels.

Grayscale and Filtered Variations: Convert images to grayscale and apply simple filtering techniques.


Technologies Used

Python 3.x

NumPy for numerical operations

Matplotlib for visualization

PIL (Pillow) for image handling
